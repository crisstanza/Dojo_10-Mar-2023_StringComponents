## Instructions:

This entire project can run as a simple local page: just double click the `index.html` file.

But it's easier (and funnier!) to use `browser-sync` to auto refresh the changes. At your favourite bash terminal:

    ./.bash install     # run this ONLY ONCE to install
    ./.bash start       # run this to launch the application
